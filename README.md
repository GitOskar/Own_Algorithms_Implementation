# Own Algorithm Implementation
Repository contains algorithms implemented by me. All of them are made in C++ and were a projects for my studies. Some of them may contain implementation of data structures (I could not use standard template library) and other parts of code as I had to store everything for the project in one cpp file.
## Backtracking
Implementation of backtracking problem.\
Algorithm complexity: O(2^n)
## Dijkstra Algorithm
Implementation of finding the shortest path by dijkstra algorithm by priority queue. \
Algorithm complexity: O(v*log(v))
## Ford-Bellman algorithm
Implementation of finding the shortest path by Ford-Bellman algorithm. \
Algorithm complexity: O(V*E)
## BFS
Algorithm for finding the shortest path in a graph with no value on the edges.
## RSA decoder
Implementation of RSA decoder. Algorithm has to have public key and 2 prime numbers to create private key.
## Hoare algorithm
Algorithm implemented to find min values. Algorithm uses same partition like quick sort. \
Algorithm complexity: O(log(n))
## Sorting algorithms in O(n)
Algorithm contain 3 different sorting algorithms: \
Counting sort \
Bucket sort \
Position sort \
Algorithms complexity: O(n)
## Graph Algorithm
Just algorithm that use graph to obtain the optimal solution of a problem.
## Greedy Algorithm
Greedy algorithm implementation
## Insertion sort
Implementation of insertion sort \
Algorithm complexity: O(n^2)
## Text algorithm + set implementation
Algorithm that has to find number of given substring. \
Algorithm complexity: O(n*log(n))
